							Since I moved to the US from Vietnam two years ago, I have had held two part-time jobs and
							in 2021 decided to return to my studies. I completed a bachelorâ€™s degree in Banking and
							Finance in Vietnam, but as a student now, the most interesting thing is using my second
							language, English, in class. Upon taking up my studies again, I was nervous despite having
							previously worked in accounting, but I learned a lot. Overcoming this initial challenge of
							using my second language in a field I studied before, I decided to undertake a greater
							challenge and join University of Connecticutâ€™s Certificate in Coding Course.
